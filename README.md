## Inspiration
Thanksgiving weekend 2019, I started reading 
[**Getting Things Done**](https://www.amazon.com/Getting-Things-Done-Stress-Free-Productivity/dp/0143126563) by David Allen.
During my plane rides, I had the idea to turn this into an app that could facilitate the GTD process.

That would have the dual benefit of cementing these practices for me 
and also building a robust app that I can proudly show off in my portfolio.

## To-Dos

## Acknowledgments 

* Colt Steele's [Web Development Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp/) was my launching off point for this application.
* Stephen Grider's [Complete Developer's Guide to MongoDB](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-developers-guide-to-mongodb/) has also been extremely helpful in structuring the server logic of the app.
* Finally, Tony Alicea's works on JavaScript and NodeJS provide an invaluable baseline for understanding the technologies I'm using.
