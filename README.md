## Inspiration
Thanksgiving weekend 2019, I started reading 
[**Getting Things Done**](https://www.amazon.com/Getting-Things-Done-Stress-Free-Productivity/dp/0143126563) by David Allen.
During my plane rides, I had the idea to turn this into an app that could facilitate the GTD process.

That would have the dual benefit of cementing these practices for me 
and also building a robust app that I can proudly show off in my portfolio.

## To-Dos
Visit Estuary's [about page](https://cpustejovsky-estuary.herokuapp.com/about) for the latest to-dos.

Current project is rebuilding Estuary's server in Go and database in PostgreSQL.

## Acknowledgments 

* Tony Alicea's works on JavaScript and NodeJS provide an invaluable baseline for understanding the technologies I'm using.
* Colt Steele's [Web Development Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp/) was my launching off point for this application.
* Stephen Grider's [Complete Developer's Guide to MongoDB](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-developers-guide-to-mongodb/) has been extremely helpful in structuring the server logic of the app along with setting up Mocha testing.
* Grider's [Modern React with Redux](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-redux/learn/lecture/12531438#overview) helped me set up the React front-end for this app.
* Grider's [Node with React: Fullstack Web Development](https://www.udemy.com/course/node-with-react-fullstack-web-development/learn/lecture/7604946#overview) helped me connect my backend and frontend.
