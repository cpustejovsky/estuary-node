      <h1>What is Estuary?</h1>
      <p>
        I created Estuary as a test project. I wanted something with similar
        functionality to
        <a href="https://750words.com" target="_blank">750 Words</a> but with
        more customizability for me personally. And that's what this app is: a
        testing ground for increased functionality and more features using
        NodeJS and MongoDB
      </p>
      <h3>What can Estuary do so far?</h3>
      <p>Well, you can do the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Register and create a user</li>
        <li>Log in and log out of your account</li>
        <li>Create free writes or notes that save to the database</li>
        <li>
          Take notes during your free write by hitting
          <strong>enter</strong> beginning the new line with
          <strong>#n</strong> or <strong>#N</strong> and then hitting
          <strong>enter</strong> again
        </li>
        <li>email a list of your notes to yourself at the push of a button</li>
        <li>
          set the option to receive email updates of your notes every day at
          6:00am EST
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>What's under the hood?</h3>
      <p>Here's what running Estuary behind the scenes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>EJS templates (no fancy Front-End framework yet)</li>
        <li>BootStrap and some custom CSS</li>
        <li>Express for the routing</li>
        <li>NodeJS for the server-side logic</li>
        <li>MongoDB and Mongoose for Database and ORM, respectively</li>
        <li>Heroku and GitHub for deployment</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Have any ideas for improvements?</h3>
